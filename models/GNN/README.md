GNN0 Model
- Roughly GNN model from tutorial modifed to predict node-wise target 

Data Features: Node: [atomic number, formal charge, electronegativity enviroment, orbital identifier]
                Edge: [bond type]


GNN0.py -- runs model training from command line. Requires input file with pytorch graphs
GNN0.pt -- Trained model
graphs.pt -- Pytorch formatted graphs
